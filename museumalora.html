Some researchers do not hesitate to place the city of Iluro on the Hill of Towers, when a cistern and remains of Roman ashlars used for the construction of the Castle are found. While others place it in the Roman site of Canca, due to the appearance of monumental hot springs and because this is a large place with abundant water.<br><br>The truth is that according to epigraphic inscriptions, Iluro, had a municipal statute "Municipium Iluritanum" and was governed by two Duunviros.<br><br></p>

The inferior one, of irregular form, adapts to the relief by means of canvases of masonry wall. Between the two enclosures there is a square tower that must have been the Tower of the Candle of the castle, at whose feet was the greater mosque.<br><br>The fortress would be the central organ on which the different sites found in the municipality would depend such as, El Sabinar, El Castillejo, Paredones and Los Cerrajones. That is why, there are numerous coins found in its surroundings, due to the great commercial activity of Al-Andalus. It is also important to highlight the use of ditches and reservoirs for irrigation and water collection in citrus orchards, while the dry land cultivation was based on large areas of land, sown with wheat and olive trees.</p>

In this same Plaza, during the reign of Felipe II, Cervantes was as a king's collector for seven years. In 1624 Felipe IV visits Álora and signs the Malaga Segregation Act. According to the cadastre of the Marquis de la Ensenada, year 1751, Álora had 500 neighbors.<br><br>The arrival of the nineteenth century is marked by the patriotism of the War of Independence, with bullet impacts remaining in the tower of the Church, when the commemorative plaque of the Constitution of the Cortes of Cádiz is demolished. An important change for the municipality, was the construction of the Casas-Hotelitos at the station, summer residence of the Loring, Heredia and Larios families of Malaga, this meant that in 1863, the section of the road linking Malaga with Álora was completed .</p>
